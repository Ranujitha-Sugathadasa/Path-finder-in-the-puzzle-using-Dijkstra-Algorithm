# Path-finder-in-the-puzzle-using-Dijkstra-Algorithm
This project finds the shortest path through a maze using a 2D array, Node class, PriorityQueue, Dijkstra's Algorithm, and BFS. Nodes are stored in a 2D array for efficient lookup. Dijkstra's Algorithm calculates minimum distances, while BFS ensures the shortest path in unweighted graphs, making the solution efficient and straightforward.
